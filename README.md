# Introduction
CPP00-CPP04 are rank 4 projects at **Hive** Helsinki, which is a school in the 42 network. They serve as an introduction to c++ and I had an immensely good time completing them.
I love this language and I hope to do a lot more using it in the future.

## **Description**
### **CPP00**
From the subject: this module taught us about *Namespaces, classes, member functions, stdio streams, initialization lists, static, const, and some other basic stuff*

### **CPP01**
The focus of this module is *Memory allocation, pointers to members, references, switch statement*

### **CPP02**
In this module we learned about *Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading and Orthodox Canonical class form*

### **CPP03**
This module was all about inheritance.

### **CPP04**
In this final module we learned about *Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, and interfaces*

There are 5 additional CPP modules, but the get their own folder.
